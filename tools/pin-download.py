"""Point mod.json at one release asset and publish that file's sha256.

CI runs this after publishing a release, so the checksum tracks every build without anyone
remembering. The manual forms are for repairing drift:

    python3 tools/pin-download.py                                  # newest release, via the API
    python3 tools/pin-download.py v2026.08.09.5                    # a specific release
    python3 tools/pin-download.py --dist dist --tag v2026.08.09.5  # hash the local zip (what CI runs)
    python3 tools/pin-download.py --check                          # report drift, write nothing

WHAT THE HASH IS FOR
--------------------
It pins the identity of a published artifact. PUNK Nexus REFUSES an install whose bytes do not
match, so once a release is out the manifest says "this exact file and no other", and a zip swapped
at the download url afterwards is rejected rather than installed.

WHY THE URL IS PINNED, NOT LEFT AS repo+assetPattern
----------------------------------------------------
`assetPattern` resolves to whatever the NEWEST release is. Pair that with a checksum and there is a
window, every single release, where the pointer has already moved to the new asset while the
manifest still carries the old hash -- and because a mismatch blocks, that window is one where
nobody can install this mod at all.

A pinned url has no such window. Until this script commits, the manifest names the PREVIOUS release
and the hash OF that release: internally consistent, just one build behind.

The repo ships with `repo` + `assetPattern` so the manifest is valid before any release exists. The
first run of this script replaces that pair with a url, and it never comes back.

THE PACKAGED COPY
-----------------
The workflow copies mod.json into the zip, so the copy inside an artifact cannot contain that
artifact's own hash. It does not need to: the client verifies against the PUBLISHED manifest and
reads the packaged one only for the installed version.
