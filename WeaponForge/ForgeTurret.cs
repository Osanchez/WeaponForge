{
    // Turns a projectile into a DEPLOYABLE TURRET / MINE: while it is alive
    // it repeatedly fires another weapon, and (optionally) damages anything
    // touching it.
    //
    // Why this exists: the game has NO "while alive" hook on a projectile -
    // subEmitter only fires on death (range end / lifetime end / impact).
    // The game's own ProjectileDispenser fires a weapon from a live object,
    // but its weapon field is private and it only fires on Start, so it
    // can't be driven from JSON. This component is the same idea with full
    // control: it ticks on an interval, aims (rotating sweep or nearest
    // enemy), and follows the projectile because each volley builds a fresh
    // FakeBarrel at the CURRENT position.
    //
    // It is a plain MonoBehaviour on the projectile prefab, so Unity drives
    // Start/Update for us - no Harmony patch needed. Start() runs after the
    // game's FireSingle has set Owner/Damage, so those are safe to read.
    //
    // Firing costs NO resource: WeaponBase.Fire() only spawns projectiles;
    // the resource deduction lives in Shooter.Shoot, which we never touch.
